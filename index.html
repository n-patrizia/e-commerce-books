        <h1 class="subtitle previous-mvp">Overview</h1>
        <p>Hill of contents is a bookstore with stores in Melbourne and Sydeny. Its aims are to provide a wide range of
            books - published locally and abroad - in a pleasant browsing environment. The company prides itself on
            providing friendly and personalized customer service. <br><br>
            A redesign of their website was requested for a specific type of user: the spontaneous selector. The
            shopping patterns of this user are as follows:</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>“I loves chance discoveries.”</li>

            <li>“Buying products because they are trendy or popular isn't a reason I buy them.”</li>

            <li>“When something comes into my radar, I buy it.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="subtitle previous-mvp">The design process</h1>
        <p>As part of my research for this project, I looked at Hill of Content Melbourne's website (they also have a
            Sydney store website) and their social media accounts with interest in their customers' comments.
            Thus, I was able to learn more about the product and tailor the site specifically for the spontaneous
            selector.
        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">The product</h1>
        <p>I conducted a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/"
                target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">heuristic
                evaluation</a>. In the 90s, Jakob Nielsen introduced a way to judge
            user interfaces based
            on ten well-proven human-computer interaction principles.</p>

        <div class="pic">
            <img src="./img/HEURISTIC-TABLE.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>In the table abow, you can see that there were many system status errors, where mouse clicks and hovers
            yielded different outcomes. Lack of predictability creates a lack of trust in a brand and a product, and
            these errors must be corrected.<br><br>
            To see how competitors have addressed the issues of categorization, site navigation, I looked at Booktopia
            and Dymocks.
            I reviewed numerous checkout experiences from various fashion andgrocery retailers. In terms of impulse
            purchases, both of theseproducts are at the top of the list.
        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">The user</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">I defined the following key words to clarify the Spontaneous Selector personality:</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>A casual attitude.</li>

            <li>An instinctive response.</li>

            <li>Is attracted to simple designs.</li>

            <li>A tendency to act on impulse.</li>

            <li>As a means of defining the user's perspective.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I conducted a user research study where I recruited candidates who agreed with the phrase: "when I shop, I
            love discovering things by chance."
            As they browsed the book section on booktopia, I discovered how much they love browsing.
        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">As a reference, I sketched a user browsing diagram.</h1>

        <div class="pic">
            <img src="./img/USER-FLOW-SS.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h1 class="subtitle">The solution</h1>
        <p>Users can now quickly access categories, best sellers, new releases, and more from a menu bar. <br>
            In order to avoid a complete change to the website at this point, I chose not to delete the browse by
            subject section on the left column. <br>
            I designed a quick and easy check-out process that doesn't require an account and I've fixed all heuristic
            errors.
            <br> <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;"> My goal is to intrigue and appeal to the curiosity of the Spontaneous
                Selector through the browsing
                experience.</span>
            <br>
            As a result, I added some tiles inviting the user to discover new titles while playing games like Quiz and
            Treasure Hunt.
        </p>

        <div class="pic wireframe">

        </div>
        <section class="boxes">
            <div class="box">
                <img src="./img/TREASURE-HUNT.jpg" class="image">
                <h2>Treasure hunt page</h2>
                <p>Hovering over the square images reveals the book on the right.
                    Products such as bookmarks, diaries, and gifts will be displayed in triangles and stars.
                </p>

            <div class="box">

                <h2>Quiz page</h2>
                <p>The user finds book recommendations based on their responses after answering some questions.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Users testing</h1>
        <p>During the user testing with 5 users, there was no doubt that I was on the right track. One problem I found
            was the word "hunt", which made the majority of candidates think of pirates. <br>
            Among the candidates, one said:
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
            "I expect random chance items. Stuff that the I won’t otherwise come across”, the word <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure Hunt</span>
            makes me think it’s about pirates”.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>As a result, I changed the title of the section to <span style="font-weight: bold;">"finding the
                unexpected"</span> for the final prototype.
        </p>

        <div class="btn-proto">
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/1JskGzA1YOF5Q0P6Z8Ww2P/EasyDollar-MVP?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank"
                class="proto">See

        </div>

        <h1 class="subtitle">More users testing feedback</h1>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“The navigation itself works, as a buyer I would go straight
            to the tiles. Having the tiles works well because it’s also flexible (for the
            business) to visualize promotions, clearance... (etch)”
        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">“I love how interactive and fun you've tried to make the site!”.
        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">“I like that you have thought outside the box for ideas on how to get customers
            involved.”.

        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Nice, clean, approachable wireframes”.
